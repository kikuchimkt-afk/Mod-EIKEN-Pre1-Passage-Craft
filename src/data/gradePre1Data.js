      title: "Relying on Nature",
      content: `## Title: Relying on Nature\n\nIt was once thought that the use of medicine was a uniquely human trait, but over the past fifty years or so, scientists have reported many cases of animals using natural remedies to self-medicate. Plants produce many chemical substances to protect themselves against disease or prevent themselves from being eaten by animals and insects, and some of these chemicals have medicinal properties. A growing body of research shows that animals have learned to recognize and consume these substances to treat and prevent illnesses.\n\nSelf-medication by animals was first recorded in the 1970s by researchers studying a group of chimpanzees in Tanzania. They observed some chimpanzees in the group swallowing the leaves of plants that were not a part of their regular diet. Since the chimpanzees were swallowing the leaves whole without chewing them, they were obviously not consuming them for nutritional purposes, and further observations revealed that the behavior occurred more frequently when stomach parasites were common among the group. The researchers hypothesized that the leaves were being used to remove the parasites, and they used the term "zoopharmacognosy" to refer to this self-medicating behavior.\n\nFor many years, it was believed by most scientists that this behavior was limited to animals with advanced intellectual ability. This belief originated mainly from the initial observations of chimpanzees, which suggested that the behavior had to be learned and passed on from generation to generation. However, a recent review of research has shown that self-medication is much more common than was previously thought and is even demonstrated by some insects. This suggests that self-medication must also occur by instinct, and many scientists now believe that it can be both innate and learned, even in more intelligent animals.\n\nOne of the best-studied examples of self-medication in insects is that of fruit flies. These tiny flies are often targeted by a type of parasitic wasp that lays its eggs inside the flies' bodies. Research has shown that fruit flies infected by parasitic wasps deliberately consume food containing alcohol, such as rotting fruit. The alcohol prevents the development of the wasp larvae and protects the flies. Consuming food with high alcohol content is normally harmful to the flies, so they avoid doing so when they are healthy. This implies that something triggers them to seek out such food only when they have wasp larvae inside them, and scientists seem to have determined the chemical compound that causes it. In other studies, it has also been found that the use of natural medication by some social insects goes beyond self-medication. When bacterial and fungal infections occur within an ant colony, for example, the insects collect resin from nearby trees and take it back to the colony. The resin has antibacterial and antifungal properties, so by doing this, the ants are performing a form of "social medication."\n\nMany scientists believe it is likely that our human ancestors gained knowledge of medicinal plants by observing the behavior of animals. They also hope that further research into zoopharmacognosy will help to improve human health care by providing clues to new sources of medicines.`,
      questions: `### Questions\n\n**(1) What did a group of researchers in the 1970s conclude?**\n1. Most of the reported cases of animals using natural substances for medicinal purposes were false.\n2. Most chemical substances produced by plants were harmful to animals even when only consumed in small amounts.\n3. Chimpanzees supplemented their diets with leaves when they could not get adequate nutrition from their usual food sources.\n4. Chimpanzees deliberately ate the leaves of certain plants when they were suffering from parasitic infections.\n\n**(2) What did most scientists believe for many years?**\n1. Animals did not self-medicate because consuming unknown substances went against their natural instincts.\n2. The kinds of plants that animals used for medicinal purposes changed from one generation to the next.\n3. Animals with low intelligence could not self-medicate because they lacked the ability to learn how to do so.\n4. All animals were born with the ability to recognize natural substances that have medicinal properties.\n\n**(3) What is one thing the author of the passage says about fruit flies?**\n1. Consuming alcohol is damaging to their health but overall beneficial when they are infected by parasitic wasps.\n2. The consumption of food containing alcohol weakens them and makes them more vulnerable to parasitic wasps.\n3. They intentionally become infected by parasitic wasps in order to reduce the harmful effects of alcohol.\n4. They have developed a strategy to prevent parasitic wasps from being able to lay eggs inside them.\n\n**(4) Research has shown that some social insects**\n1. produce a substance that can protect themselves and their colony from bacterial and fungal infections.\n2. leave their colony when they are suffering from infectious diseases to prevent the disease from spreading.\n3. use natural medication in a way that benefits their whole colony rather than just themselves.\n4. have the ability to teach other members of their colony how to deal with bacterial and fungal infections.\n\n---\n**Answer Key:** (1) 4, (2) 3, (3) 1, (4) 3`,

      title: "Tools of the Wild",
      content: `## Title: Tools of the Wild\n\nIt was long maintained by anthropologists that tool use was the defining line between humans and other animals. For centuries, humans were referred to as "Man the Toolmaker," based on the assumption that only the human intellect could conceive of using an external object to alter the environment. However, over the past sixty years, this definition has been dismantled by a flood of discoveries revealing that tool use is far more widespread in the animal kingdom than previously imagined.\n\nThe turning point came in 1960, when Jane Goodall, a young researcher in Tanzania, observed chimpanzees stripping leaves off twigs to fashion primitive fishing rods. The chimpanzees would insert these modified twigs into termite mounds to catch insects. This observation was revolutionary because the chimpanzees were not merely using objects they found; they were modifying them to suit a specific purpose. This challenged the scientific community to redefine what it meant to be human, suggesting that the cognitive gap between humans and other primates was not as wide as once believed.\n\nFor decades following Goodall's discovery, most scientists held onto the belief that while tool use existed in nature, it was restricted to animals with high intelligence, such as primates and crows. The prevailing theory was that tool use required "insight"—the ability to mentally plan an action—and therefore had to be a learned behavior passed down through culture. However, recent studies have overturned this view by finding tool use in animals with much smaller brains, including fish and insects. This implies that such behaviors can be driven by instinct rather than complex cognition, or that the definition of intelligence needs to be broadened.\n\nOne remarkable example in the insect world involves the solitary digger wasp. When a female wasp builds a nest burrow in the ground, she captures prey to feed her future offspring and then seals the entrance. To do this, she picks up a small pebble in her jaws and uses it as a hammer to pack down the soil over the hole, concealing the nest from parasites. Unlike chimpanzees, who learn by watching others, the wasp’s behavior appears to be genetically hardwired. In contrast, some social insects like weaver ants exhibit cooperative tool use. They hold their own larvae in their jaws and use the silk produced by the larvae as a "glue gun" to stitch leaves together for their communal nests. This demonstrates that tool use can serve not just individual survival, but the needs of an entire society.\n\nToday, the study of animal tool use continues to evolve. It challenges our understanding of the origins of technology and suggests that the ability to manipulate the world is not a unique human privilege, but a fundamental survival strategy that has emerged independently across many branches of the tree of life.`,
      questions: `### Questions\n\n**(1) What was the significance of Jane Goodall's observation in 1960?**\n1. It proved that chimpanzees preferred eating termites over their regular diet of fruit and leaves.\n2. It showed that humans were the only species capable of creating tools to alter their environment.\n3. It revealed that chimpanzees could modify natural objects to create tools, challenging the definition of humanity.\n4. It demonstrated that tool use in primates was purely instinctual and did not involve any learning process.\n\n**(2) What was the prevailing scientific belief about tool use for many years after Goodall's discovery?**\n1. Tool use was a common trait found in almost all animal species regardless of their brain size.\n2. The ability to use tools was limited to intelligent animals and likely required the ability to plan actions.\n3. Insects and fish were more skilled at using tools than primates because they relied on instinct.\n4. Tool use was a genetic trait that did not need to be learned or taught by other members of the group.\n\n**(3) What does the author say about the digger wasp?**\n1. It uses a pebble to pound the earth in order to hide its nest and protect its offspring.\n2. It learns how to use tools by observing other wasps in the colony building their nests.\n3. It uses stones to break open hard soil so that it can easily dig a burrow for its eggs.\n4. It cooperates with other wasps to move large stones that are too heavy for one wasp to carry.\n\n**(4) Weaver ants are different from digger wasps because they**\n1. rely on a genetic program to perform their tool-using behaviors without learning.\n2. use tools to capture prey rather than for constructing shelter for their young.\n3. utilize their tools in a way that benefits the collective group rather than just a single individual.\n4. lack the ability to produce the materials needed for building their nests on their own.\n\n---\n**Answer Key:** (1) 3, (2) 2, (3) 1, (4) 3`,

### 1. Relying on Nature (過去問)

本文は、動物が植物などを利用して病気を治す「自己治療（Zoopharmacognosy）」に関する科学的認識の変遷についての説明文です。

#### 1. Introduction (第1段落)
かつて薬の使用は人間特有の能力（uniquely human trait）と考えられていましたが、過去50年の研究により、動物も自然の治療薬を利用して自己治療を行うことが明らかになりました。

#### 2. The First Record (第2段落)
1970年代、タンザニアのチンパンジーが、普段食べない植物の葉を噛まずに丸呑みする行動が初めて記録されました。これは栄養摂取ではなく、胃の寄生虫を除去するための行動であると仮説が立てられ、「動物生薬学（zoopharmacognosy）」と名付けられました。

#### 3. Shift in Understanding (第3段落)
長年、この行動は高度な知能が必要であり、学習によって継承されると信じられていました。しかし近年、昆虫などでも同様の行動が確認されたことから、本能（instinct）による先天的な側面もあるという認識へと変化しました。

#### 4. Insect Examples (第4段落)
具体的な事例として、ショウジョウバエは寄生バチの幼虫に対し、アルコールを含む餌を摂取して対抗します（個体の生存）。また、社会性昆虫であるアリは、樹脂を集めてコロニー内の感染を防ぐという「社会的治療（social medication）」を行います。

---

### 2. Tools of the Wild (オリジナル)

本文は、動物界における「道具の使用（Tool Use）」に関する科学的認識の変遷についての説明文です。

#### 1. The Broken Definition (第1段落)
かつて道具の使用は人間と動物を分ける境界線であり、人間は「工作人（Man the Toolmaker）」と呼ばれていました。しかし過去60年の発見により、その定義は崩れ去りました。

#### 2. The Turning Point (第2段落)
1960年、ジェーン・グドールがチンパンジーによる「釣り竿」の作成（葉を取り除く加工）を観察しました。これは単なる道具の利用ではなく「加工」を含んでいたため、人間性の定義を揺るがす革命的な発見となりました。

#### 3. Shift in Understanding (第3段落)
長年、道具使用は霊長類のような「知能（洞察力）」を持つ動物に限られ、文化的に学習されるものだと考えられていました。しかし、近年では魚や昆虫など脳の小さな動物でも確認され、本能による道具使用も存在することが明らかになりました。

#### 4. Insect Examples (第4段落)
本能的な道具使用の例として、ジガバチ（Digger Wasp）が紹介されます。彼らは巣を隠すために小石をハンマーとして使い地面を固めます。対照的に、ツムギアリ（Weaver Ants）は幼虫の吐く糸を接着剤として使い、集団で葉を縫い合わせるという「社会的」な道具使用を行います。これは過去問の「自己治療」から「社会的治療（Social Medication）」への流れと対応しています。

      title: "The Science of Revenge",
      content: `## Title: The Science of Revenge\n\nWhile revenge is a phenomenon found in cultures around the globe, this dark human instinct is still not fully understood. One famous psychological theory of the past viewed it as a way to release the buildup of rage or hatred that occurs in situations where a person feels victimized, just as releasing steam can decrease pressure in a steam engine. Psychological studies, however, have revealed that aggressive acts associated with revenge can actually leave people with increased levels of anger compared with those who do not attempt to get even.\n\nIt is generally agreed that evolution has played a part in bringing about the human tendency toward revenge. Revenge seems to be common in various animal species, and our close relatives, chimpanzees, frequently retaliate against aggression. Since they share much of our DNA, it suggests there is a biological mechanism at work. In addition, since human ancestors in ancient times faced frequent threats, such as murder and theft, an instinct for getting even would have proved beneficial in discouraging others from harming them. Research has also revealed that males, particularly those with greater upper-body strength, have a greater tendency toward revenge. This suggests that the drive to get even may be linked to evolutionary pressures since those who were more capable of enacting revenge had a better chance of survival and protecting the resources they needed to live.\n\nHowever, human society may also have shaped revenge. Researchers have found that revenge tends to occur more frequently in societies where institutions for enforcing laws are less developed. Tribal peoples with no formal justice system, for example, are more likely to retaliate than people in urban settings with sophisticated law enforcement systems. Similarly, low-income neighborhoods in the United States often suffer from a lack of law enforcement, and there is a greater tendency for their residents to retaliate when they are victims of crime. While not proven, this cultural view of revenge appears useful for understanding the great degree of variation that exists in societies around the world.\n\nA cultural approach to understanding the possible origins of revenge can also help us see its effects not just on individuals but on society as a whole. Taking revenge can come at great personal cost, including damage to human relationships, imprisonment, or even loss of life, as well as leading to a cycle of revenge. However, revenge may also send a message that affects the behavior of everyone in the society by making it clear that certain types of actions will not be tolerated. As well as making people aware of what not to do, it can indirectly lead to beneficial actions. For example, on a soccer team, if players put in little effort during practice, other players may resent them and avoid passing them the ball during the game. The potential for such retaliation can contribute to a team's overall motivation in practices. It is, therefore, possible that revenge developed because it can have a positive impact on the members of a group or society, reinforcing behaviors that contribute positively to its overall success.`,
      questions: `### Questions\n\n**(1) What is one thing that we learn about an older psychological theory of revenge?**\n1. It had a problem because it focused on the reasons that people wanted to get revenge rather than the degree of anger they felt.\n2. It was created using the results of a well-known psychological study, but it reached an incorrect conclusion about them.\n3. It was based on a misunderstanding about the relationship between victims and the people who cause harm to them.\n4. It incorrectly suggested that revenge worked to reduce the amount of negative emotion, such as anger, that a wronged person felt.\n\n**(2) Which of the following is mentioned as an advantage of taking revenge for early humans?**\n1. It may have been a way for males to demonstrate their physical strength and their ability to protect females from danger.\n2. It could have helped to keep them safe from animals because it brought out anger, making them better able to respond to attacks.\n3. It would have had the effect of helping to prevent other people from trying to kill them or steal their belongings.\n4. It seems to have provided a way for them to handle stress related to suffering caused by the harmful actions of other humans.\n\n**(3) The author mentions low-income neighborhoods in the United States as an example that**\n1. demonstrates that revenge seems to be more common in societies where the justice system is not working well.\n2. supports the idea that the desire to get revenge has an unexpected connection with how much wealth an individual possesses.\n3. shows that societies with strict punishments for criminals are likely to have much lower rates of crime than those that do not.\n4. helps to explain the changes that have come about as tribal societies gradually changed into more-modern ones.\n\n**(4) According to the fourth paragraph, what is one positive effect of revenge?**\n1. It can actually strengthen personal relationships among people who feel that they have been the victims of harm from others.\n2. It can cause people to follow social rules so that they are more likely to behave in a way that is acceptable to the group.\n3. It can allow individuals a chance to make a situation fairer when they are being treated badly by the rest of society.\n4. It can indirectly lead to increased competition that can cause many people in society to enjoy greater success.\n\n---\n**Answer Key:** (1) 4, (2) 3, (3) 1, (4) 2`,

      title: "The Dynamics of Envy",
      content: `## Title: The Dynamics of Envy\n\nAlthough envy is an emotion experienced by people in every culture, this powerful human instinct is often viewed purely as a character flaw. Traditional religious and moral teachings have long described it as a "green-eyed monster" or a destructive poison that causes useless suffering to the person who feels it. Modern psychological research, however, has drawn a distinction between malicious envy, which aims to harm others, and benign envy, which motivates people to improve themselves. Studies indicate that benign envy can actually act as a positive force, driving individuals to work harder and achieve better results than those who do not compare themselves to others.\n\nIt is widely accepted that evolution has played a significant role in developing the human capacity for envy. Sensitivity to unequal treatment is found in many primate species, and capuchin monkeys, for instance, will famously refuse a reward if they see a partner receiving a better one. Since humans share this trait with other primates, it implies a biological root. Furthermore, because human ancestors lived in environments where resources were scarce, an instinct for noticing when others had more food or status would have been essential for survival. By alerting individuals to disadvantages, envy likely encouraged them to compete for the resources necessary to survive and reproduce.\n\nHowever, the expression of envy is also shaped by social structures. Anthropologists have observed that envy tends to be more feared and suppressed in societies that view wealth as a fixed quantity. In many peasant communities, for example, one person's gain is seen as another's loss, leading to a strong social pressure to avoid appearing too successful. Conversely, in modern competitive economies where growth is seen as unlimited, envy is often channeled into ambition. Although not definitive, this perspective helps explain why attitudes toward success and inequality vary so dramatically across different cultures.\n\nA functional approach to envy also reveals its impact on group stability. While envy can cause personal stress and conflict, it may also serve as a mechanism that regulates social behavior by discouraging arrogance among the powerful. The fear of being envied can lead successful individuals to be more generous and cooperative. For example, in some hunter-gatherer societies, successful hunters are often teased rather than praised to prevent them from becoming too dominant. This behavior, driven by the group's potential envy, ensures that resources are shared. It is, therefore, likely that envy persisted because it helps maintain balance within a group, reinforcing cooperation and preventing any single individual from monopolizing power.`,
      questions: `### Questions\n\n**(1) What is one thing that we learn about the traditional view of envy?**\n1. It was based on the idea that envy was a useful emotion that helped people identify unfairness in their society.\n2.

It correctly identified that envy was caused by a lack of resources but failed to explain how to stop it.\n4. It suggested that people who felt envy were more likely to become successful than those who were content.\n\n**(2) Which of the following is mentioned as an advantage of envy for early humans?**\n1. It allowed them to form stronger bonds with other primates by sharing resources more equally.\n2. It helped them to identify which members of the group were physically the strongest and most capable of leading.\n3. It would have motivated them to secure the food and status needed to stay alive in difficult environments.\n4. It enabled them to avoid conflict with others by accepting that some individuals would always have more than others.\n\n**(3) The author mentions peasant communities as an example that**\n1. illustrates how the fear of envy can be stronger in societies where resources are perceived as limited.\n2. proves that envy is less common in close-knit groups where everyone knows each other well.\n3. shows that societies with strict social rules are able to eliminate the negative effects of envy completely.\n4. supports the idea that modern economies have created a form of envy that did not exist in the past.\n\n**(4) According to the fourth paragraph, what is one positive effect of envy?**\n1. It encourages successful individuals to hide their wealth so that they do not cause stress to others.\n2. It can act as a social control that prevents individuals from keeping too much power or resources for themselves.\n3. It leads to a system where the most successful members are given the right to rule over the rest of the group.\n4.

### **1. The Science of Revenge (過去問)**

本文は、一般的に否定的な感情とされる「復習（Revenge）」の科学的・進化的意義についての説明文です。

**1. Old View vs Reality (第1段落)**
かつて復讐は「怒りの圧力を下げる手段」と考えられていましたが、現代の研究では、実際には怒りを増大させることが明らかになっています。

**2. Evolutionary Roots (第2段落)**
復讐には生物学的・進化的ルーツがあります。チンパンジーの報復行動や、祖先が殺人・盗難などの脅威から身を守るための抑止力として役立ちました。

**3. Cultural Influence (第3段落)**
法執行が未発達な社会や低所得地域では、公的な正義に代わって復讐が頻発する傾向があり、社会構造が復讐の頻度を左右します。

**4. Social Function (第4段落)**
復讐は個人的な犠牲を伴う一方で、社会に規範を認識させ、間接的に協力やモチベーションを高める（例：サッカーチーム）という集団的メリットを持ちます。

### **2. The Dynamics of Envy (オリジナル)**

本文は、一般的に否定的な感情とされる「嫉妬（Envy）」の科学的・進化的意義についての説明文です。

**1. Traditional vs Modern (第1段落)**
嫉妬は伝統的に「負の感情」とされてきましたが、現代心理学では自己改善を促す「良性の嫉妬」を区別し、それが成長の原動力になることを示しています。

**2. Biological Mechanism (第2段落)**
霊長類（オマキザル）に見られる「不公平への敏感さ」が示すように、嫉妬には生物学的根拠があり、資源が乏しい環境で生き残るための競争本能として発達しました。

**3. Social Structures (第3段落)**
富が有限とされる農村社会では嫉妬は抑制対象ですが、無限の成長を前提とする現代経済では野心に転換されるなど、社会構造によって表現が変わります。

**4. Leveling Function (第4段落)**
嫉妬は権力者の傲慢さを抑止し、資源の独占を防ぐ「社会的制御（Social Control）」として機能し、集団内のバランスと協力を維持する役割を果たしています。

      title: "Age and Innovation",
      content: `One benchmark that is used to measure technological progress is Moore's law. This law, which was originally published by US engineer and businessman Gordon Moore in 1965, states that the number of transistors on a microchip will double every two years. Moore originally intended this as a prediction regarding computer technology, but it became the driving force behind the rapid progress in computer technology that has occurred since then. The law implied that computers would continue to become smaller and more powerful, and tech companies started to plan their product development around this principle. Most experts now consider that Moore's law was responsible for innovations such as home computers and smartphones that have become essential parts of modern life.\n\nMoore's law has largely held true, but only because the amount of manpower and time used to make it possible have also greatly increased. As a paper by researchers from two universities in the United States concludes, "The constant exponential growth implied by Moore's law has been achieved only by a staggering increase in the amount of resources devoted to pushing the frontier forward." In fact, the number of researchers required to maintain the same level of innovation today is around seventy-five times more than it was in the early 1970s. Similarly, there is a general trend in many areas of society for significant progress to take longer. Political and business leaders are getting older, the average age of Nobel Prize winners is rising, and groundbreaking scientific discoveries are being made less frequently.\n\nOne theory put forward to explain this tendency is the "burden of knowledge." This states that as more innovations are made, the amount of knowledge required to make new ones grows. Innovations occur as a result of using past knowledge to find solutions to problems, so each generation has to learn an increasing amount of previously accrued knowledge before it can begin to innovate for itself. The only way to do this is to study more, which inevitably takes longer. Some studies in Germany showed that the average age of researchers in the field of mathematics when they published their first journal articles rose by five years between 1950 and 2013. The number of references to other research that were cited in the articles also increased by five times over the same period.\n\nA further obstacle to scientific and technological innovation often cited by economists is the fact that populations are aging. It is believed by some that an aging workforce holds back new discoveries because older workers are less able to learn new skills and less willing to adopt new knowledge. However, some experts believe the opposite to be true. Better diets, advances in medicine, and improved health care mean that people today not only live longer but also stay physically and mentally active until a later age. In addition, because of their experience, older workers are more efficient—and therefore more productive—than their younger colleagues and play valuable roles in passing on knowledge. These factors help to promote innovation and counterbalance the effects of the burden of knowledge.`,

      title: "Limits of the Green Revolution",
      content: `One historical milestone used to measure agricultural success is the Green Revolution. This movement, which was spearheaded by the American agronomist Norman Borlaug in the mid-20th century, involved the development of high-yielding cereal grains. Borlaug intended his research to solve the immediate problem of hunger in developing nations, but it became a global standard for food production that continues to this day. The rapid increase in crop yields implied that food supplies would always outpace population growth, and governments around the world began to design their agricultural policies based on this assumption. Today, most experts agree that the Green Revolution was responsible for saving billions of people from starvation and supporting the modern global population.\n\nHowever, the impressive growth in crop yields has begun to slow, and maintaining high levels of production now requires significantly more effort. As a study by agricultural economists in the United States concludes, "The linear growth in crop yields seen in recent decades has been sustained only by an exponential increase in research funding and chemical inputs." In fact, the financial investment required to achieve a one-percent increase in wheat yields today is vastly higher than it was during the peak of the Green Revolution in the 1960s. Similarly, there is a trend across the agricultural sector for new breakthroughs to become more elusive. New plant varieties are taking longer to develop, and the rate of productivity growth in agriculture is declining in many developed nations.\n\nOne theory proposed to explain this slowdown is the "biological ceiling." This concept suggests that there is a physiological limit to how efficient a plant can be at converting sunlight and nutrients into food. Early innovations in the Green Revolution picked the "low-hanging fruit," such as making plants shorter to support heavier grain. Now that these easy improvements have been made, scientists must tackle far more complex genetic challenges to squeeze out any further gains. This requires a deeper understanding of plant biology, meaning that modern breeders must study for longer periods and master more complex data before they can produce a viable new crop variety. Consequently, the development cycle for new crops has lengthened significantly.\n\nA further challenge to agricultural innovation cited by sociologists is the aging of the farming workforce. It is argued by some that an aging population of farmers hinders the adoption of new technologies, such as drones and AI-driven monitoring systems, because older farmers are less comfortable with digital tools. However, other experts argue that this view is misguided. Modern technology has become more user-friendly, allowing farmers to utilize advanced tools without needing specialized technical skills. Furthermore, older farmers possess decades of tacit knowledge about local weather patterns and soil health that machines cannot easily replicate. Their experience allows them to manage risk more effectively than younger, less experienced farmers. These advantages may actually enhance the stability of food production and ensure that innovations are applied more wisely.`,
      questions: `### Questions\n\n**(1) What is one thing the author says about the Green Revolution?**\n1. It failed to address the problem of hunger in developing nations despite its high costs.\n2. It led to a situation where population growth eventually overtook the supply of food.\n3. It not only provided a solution to starvation but also influenced government policies.\n4. It was originally intended to be a temporary measure rather than a long-term global standard.\n\n**(2) A study by agricultural economists in the United States concluded that**\n1. the current growth in crop yields can only be maintained by spending much more money on research than before.\n2. the use of chemicals in agriculture has decreased significantly since the peak of the Green Revolution.\n3. the amount of food produced per acre is declining rapidly in most developed nations.\n4. universities are focusing too much on wheat production and ignoring other important cereal grains.\n\n**(3) What is suggested by the theory mentioned in the third paragraph?**\n1. Plants are becoming less nutritious because scientists are focusing only on increasing their size.\n2. It is becoming harder to improve crop yields because the simplest and most effective changes have already been made.\n3. Modern breeders are less educated than those in the past, leading to a decline in the quality of new crop varieties.\n4. Genetic modifications have reached a point where they are causing unforeseen damage to the environment.\n\n**(4) According to the final paragraph, what do some experts believe?**\n1. Older farmers are preventing the agricultural industry from modernizing because they refuse to use new tools.\n2. The use of drones and AI in agriculture is unnecessary because traditional methods are still superior.\n3. Younger farmers are more likely to make risky decisions that could threaten the stability of the food supply.\n4. The experience of older farmers can be an asset that helps them use new innovations effectively.\n\n---\n**Answer Key:** (1) 3, (2) 1, (3) 2, (4) 4`,

Moore's Law (第1段落)**\n「ムーアの法則」（半導体の性能が2年で2倍になる）は、単なる予測を超えてコンピュータ技術の急速な進歩の原動力となり、現代のデジタル社会の基盤を築きました。\n\n**2. The Cost of Maintenance (第2段落)**\nしかし、この法則を維持するためには、過去と比較して莫大なリソース（75倍の研究者など）が必要になっています。これは他の科学分野でも同様で、画期的な発見が減少傾向にあります。\n\n**3. Burden of Knowledge (第3段落)**\nこの傾向を説明する「知識の負担」説によると、新しい革新を生むために学ぶべき過去の知識量が膨大になっており、研究者が独り立ちするまでの学習期間が長くなっています。\n\n**4. Aging Workforce (第4段落)**\n労働力の高齢化も懸念されていますが、一部の専門家は、高齢労働者の持つ経験や効率性が、知識の負担を相殺し、むしろイノベーションを促進する助けになると主張しています。\n\n### **2. Limits of the Green Revolution (オリジナル)**\n本文は、「緑の革命」の成功と、現在直面している農業生産性の停滞（収穫逓減）についての説明文です。\n\n**1. The Green Revolution (第1段落)**\nノーマン・ボーローグによる「緑の革命」は、飢餓を救い、食糧供給が人口増加を上回るという前提で各国の政策に影響を与えました。これはムーアの法則がIT業界に与えた影響と対比されます。\n\n**2. The Cost of Growth (第2段落)**\nしかし現在、収量の伸びは鈍化しています。過去と同じ成長を維持するためには、研究資金や化学肥料などの投入を「指数関数的」に増やす必要があります。これはイノベーションのコストが増大していることを示唆しています。\n\n**3. Biological Ceiling (第3段落)**\nこの減速の理由として「生物学的上限」説が挙げられます。初期の「低い位置にある果実（簡単な改良）」は既に収穫され、現在は複雑な遺伝子研究が必要なため、開発サイクルが長期化しています。これは「知識の負担」説に対応します。\n\n**4. The Human Factor (第4段落)**\n農業従事者の高齢化も課題とされますが、専門家の中には、高齢農家の持つ経験や暗黙知（天気や土壌への理解）が、リスク管理や技術の適切な適用において若手より有利に働くと考える人もいます。\n\n---\n講師用資料：授業前の確認や、生徒への解説の構成案としてご活用ください。`,

      title: "Bretton Woods",
      content: `In 1944, at Bretton Woods in the US state of New Hampshire, a conference of Allied countries was convened to create a stable international monetary and financial order. The period since World War I had been one of turmoil that witnessed protectionist trade policies, hyperinflation, the Great Depression, and, ultimately, World War II. Such events weighed on delegates' shoulders but also underpinned their belief that reform was urgent. Although World War II continued to rage, the pendulum was swinging strongly in the Allies' favor. Nevertheless, delegates had concerns. As one US delegate put it, "We fight together on sudden battlefields. . . . The test of this conference is whether we can walk together, solve our economic problems, down the road to peace as we today march to victory."\n\nThe conference delegates included Harry Dexter White of the US Treasury and John Maynard Keynes, a well- known British economist. The United States had become the world's most powerful economy, overtaking the colonial European powers, and the agreement that emerged reinforced its dominant position. The Bretton Woods system hinged on an arrangement that directly linked the value of the US dollar to gold. At the time, the US Federal Reserve possessed the world's largest reserves of gold, so as White pointed out, it seemed unlikely the United States would run out. The knowledge that the US dollar was backed by gold helped establish it as the world's primary reserve currency, and the other signees agreed to tie the value of their currencies to the US dollar.\n\nInitially, the dollar's stability brought some success. However, cracks began to appear. The leading European powers, for example, whose productive capabilities had been severely damaged in the war, were heavily dependent on US imports. These had to be paid for in US dollars, but some countries had insufficient dollar funds to do this. As George C.Marshall, the US secretary of state, said at the time, Europe's requirements for food imports and essential products "are so much greater than her present ability to pay that she must have substantial additional help or face economic, social, and political deterioration of a very grave character." Concerns were raised that Europe might return to protectionist trade policies, which might negatively affect the free-trade-supporting United States. To address these and other concerns, the Marshall Plan was approved to provide billions of dollars in aid.\n\nDespite such efforts, further economic challenges occurred. Germany and France effectively left the Bretton Woods system, inflation increased in many countries, and the United States saw increased domestic and military spending. Such factors affected the valuation of, and confidence in, the dollar. In 1971, the United States suspended the dollar's convertibility to gold, effectively ending the Bretton Woods system. Nevertheless, its legacy lives on in the shape of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, which emerged out of the system. The IMF's role as an organization that monitors and supports global monetary cooperation and the World Bank's loans and grants to governments in need form a core element of the modern financial order.`,
      questions: `### Questions\n\n** (1) What was the concern of the US delegate mentioned in the first paragraph?**\n\n1. It was important for delegates to admit that some fundamental problems with the interwar financial order would never be solved.\n2. European nations did not understand the need for reform, as they had not been affected by the Great Depression as much as the United States had.\n3. Holding the conference in 1944 might have been a mistake, as it was not clear that the Allies would win World War II.\n4. Although the Allies were working together to win the war, there were doubts about whether such cooperation would continue in economic fields.\n\n** (2) What was one reason put forth by Harry Dexter White to justify the structure of the Bretton Woods agreement ?**\n\n1. The United States was the only nation in a position to ensure that its currency would be stable enough to be used as a reserve currency.\n2. It was important to allow Great Britain to feel it was still equal in terms of political power to the United States despite the dominance of the US dollar.\n3. Both he and John Maynard Keynes felt European powers needed to hold onto their colonies to help them boost their productive capabilities.\n4. Other countries would be able to use their large reserves of gold to support the value of their own currencies in the international financial system.\n\n** (3) According to the author of the passage, after problems with the Bretton Woods system began to appear,**\n\n1. the European powers decided to try to raise capital by forcing other countries to pay for European food products in US dollars.\n2. the British and American delegations did their best to ensure that George C.Marshall's comments about European decline were not made public.\n3. the United States proposed protectionist trade policies as it had become clear that European countries were taking advantage of its leniency.\n4. the United States took action to assist European countries partly because doing so would also benefit the United States.\n\n**(4) What can be concluded about the Bretton Woods system?**\n\n1. The system may have been more successful if the IMF had insisted that the US dollar remained tied to gold.\n2. Although the system itself ended in failure, some economic organizations that play an important role today owe their existence to it.\n3. The United States should have ended the system earlier to prevent a loss of confidence in the US dollar as a global currency.\n4. Although both the IMF and the World Bank are influential today, their actions were considered the main reason for the system's downfall.\n\n----\n ** Answer Key:** (1) 4, (2) 1, (3) 4, (4) 2`,

      content: `In 1814, representatives from major European powers gathered in Vienna, Austria, to reconstruct Europe after the defeat of Napoleon Bonaparte. The continent had endured nearly two decades of continuous warfare, revolution, and political upheaval that had dismantled centuries-old borders and monarchies. These traumatic events weighed heavily on the diplomats, but they also strengthened their conviction that a new, lasting balance of power was essential. Although Napoleon briefly escaped exile and returned to fight, the coalition against him remained united. The prevailing sentiment was cautious hope. As British Foreign Secretary Lord Castlereagh noted, the goal was not merely to distribute the spoils of war, but to create a system where "no one power should be able to threaten the liberties of all," ensuring peace through collective security.\n\nThe key figures at the Congress included Klemens von Metternich of Austria and Castlereagh of Britain. The primary objective was to restrain France without punishing it so severely that it would seek revenge, while also checking the ambitions of Russia and Prussia. The resulting agreement, known as the Concert of Europe, hinged on a delicate balance of power rather than the domination of a single nation. Unlike the later Bretton Woods system which relied on economic mechanisms, Vienna relied on diplomatic consensus. The great powers agreed to meet regularly to resolve disputes, a concept that laid the groundwork for modern international diplomacy. They redrew the map of Europe to surround France with stronger neighbors, hoping this would contain any future French aggression.\n\nInitially, the system brought remarkable stability. For nearly 40 years, there was no major war between the great powers. However, underlying tensions began to surface. The arrangement favored the interests of established monarchies and ignored the rising tide of nationalism and liberalism among the general populations. In many territories, distinct ethnic groups were forced to live under foreign rule to satisfy the strategic needs of the great powers. As one historian observed, the diplomats "traded provinces and souls as if they were dealing with furniture," oblivious to the desires of the people. This suppression of national identity fueled revolutionary movements across Europe. By 1848, a wave of revolutions swept the continent, challenging the conservative order established at Vienna.\n\nDespite the eventual collapse of the Concert of Europe due to the Crimean War and the unification of Germany and Italy, the Congress of Vienna left a significant legacy. It established the principle that international problems should be solved through negotiation rather than conflict. The "congress system" it created was the first attempt in history to build a peaceful international order based on cooperation among major states. While it failed to stop the rise of nationalism, its model of multilateral diplomacy served as a precursor to 20th-century organizations like the League of Nations and the United Nations. The Vienna settlement demonstrated that a stable peace requires not just a military victory, but a carefully constructed political framework that accounts for the security interests of all major players.`,
      questions: `### Questions\n\n** (1) What was the main goal expressed by Lord Castlereagh regarding the Congress of Vienna ?**\n\n1. To ensure that France was punished severely enough to prevent it from ever raising an army again.\n2. To create a political environment where no single nation could become powerful enough to endanger the freedom of others.\n3. To distribute the territories conquered by Napoleon equally among the victorious Allied powers.\n4. To establish a system where economic cooperation would replace military alliances as the basis for peace.\n\n** (2) How did the agreement at Vienna differ from the structure described in the Bretton Woods passage ?**\n\n1. It relied on a balance of power and diplomatic meetings rather than economic mechanisms like currency linkage.\n2. It focused on strengthening the dominance of a single superpower rather than creating a partnership of equals.\n3. It was primarily concerned with the repayment of war debts rather than the redrawing of national borders.\n4. It allowed France to keep all its conquered territories, whereas Bretton Woods forced Germany to pay reparations.\n\n** (3) According to the passage, what was a major flaw in the system established at Vienna ?**\n\n1. It gave too much power to France, which allowed Napoleon to return and start a new war immediately.\n2. It failed to account for the economic needs of the great powers, leading to a trade war between Britain and Austria.\n3. It ignored the growing desires of people for national self - determination by prioritizing the interests of monarchs.\n4. It created a system of alliances that was too rigid, forcing countries to go to war even when they did not want to.\n\n** (4) What can be concluded about the legacy of the Congress of Vienna ?**\n\n1. It was largely a failure because it could not prevent the immediate outbreak of major wars across Europe.\n2. Its attempt to suppress nationalism was ultimately successful, preserving the European monarchies until the 20th century.\n3. Although the specific system eventually collapsed, it introduced the concept of solving international disputes through multilateral negotiation.\n4. It proved that military victory alone is sufficient to guarantee long - term peace without the need for political agreements.\n\n----\n ** Answer Key:** (1) 2, (2) 1, (3) 3, (4) 3`,

      title: "Feminist Architecture",
      content: `## Title: Feminist Architecture\n\nWhen looking at a building, not everyone considers the gender of the architect who designed it. However, in the 1980s, a group of British women architects, frustrated with the ways that the male-dominated architectural field had often failed to take women's needs into account, wrote a book describing the goals of their "feminist architecture." The group called itself Matrix, and its members designed a variety of community spaces to demonstrate its principles. While the group officially dissolved in the mid-1990s, it left behind architectural designs and an intellectual legacy that continue to shape modern approaches to architecture.\n\nThe most common architectural design philosophy that Matrix sought to change was concerned with men's comfort. Postwar construction in Britain was dominated by an architectural system called Le Modulor, first created in 1940s France. Following this system's principles, architectural design elements were arranged based on the default height of the so-called ideal man: just under two meters. While many of these elements, like tall doorways, did not negatively impact average British women—who were slightly more than one and a half meters tall on average in the 1940s—other elements, such as the tall height of stair steps, made buildings harder for them to navigate.\n\nWhen Matrix was formed in the 1980s, it did not attempt to redesign the world according to the needs of the average woman. In fact, one of Matrix's key arguments denounced architects' focus on the "average" person. The members of Matrix reasoned that architects could produce their greatest work by trying to understand the specific needs of a building's actual users, which meant involving such people in the design process to identify necessary features and integrate them into the final design. They also argued that simply training more women architects would not remedy the situation. Instead, they proposed changing the methods and design principles by which architecture was being taught.\n\nOne example of Matrix putting these values into practice when helping design public spaces in Britain is the Jagonari Women's Educational Resource Centre, which provides social services for women. Matrix worked closely with the organization's administrators to fulfill their needs and address their concerns, including installing narrow, tall windows protected by bars to help visitors feel safer. In other cases, Matrix employed methods like miniature models of proposed designs that allowed even people with little knowledge of architecture to rearrange the model rooms freely and feel included in the design process.\n\nMatrix was dedicated to helping other women enter the architecture and design industry, many of whom carried forward Matrix's principles in their own work. Although the group initially fought to address women's discontent with the biases in architecture, it came to symbolize much more. Matrix's members worked with traditionally overlooked minority groups, empowering them to have their voices reflected in the public spaces they inhabited. Even after they stopped working together, many of the women of Matrix continued to do commendable work in academic and activist spaces, where they have carried on pushing for change in how architecture is practiced, ensuring that the influence of Matrix persists to this day.`,
      questions: `### Questions\n\n**(1) What led to the formation of Matrix?**\n1. A large number of new groups being established made it difficult for individual architects to be successful by themselves.\n2. Some architects felt that people who used the buildings they designed often did not care about the person who designed them.\n3. The way in which a majority of buildings were designed at the time only considered the needs of a single group of people.\n4. Many women who worked as architects believed that feminist architecture needed to have a stronger identity.\n\n**(2) What do we learn about Le Modulor?**\n1. The fact that it was created in France meant that architects had trouble adjusting it to fit the cultural needs of people in other countries.\n2. Architects who implemented the system's design elements were often criticized for not following the default size for men.\n3. A rapid change in the average height of men and women in postwar Britain meant that buildings designed under the system quickly became difficult to use.\n4. Many of the spaces in buildings designed based on its principles were beneficial in some ways but problematic in other ways.\n\n**(3) Matrix argued against a focus on the "average" person because**\n1. most buildings were used by such a diverse range of people that it would be impossible to design something that suited everyone.\n2. doing so would likely lead architects to overlook the requirements of the actual people a building is primarily used by.\n3. the majority of people did not have sufficient knowledge to appreciate the methods and design principles that architects focused on.\n4. attempting to involve as many people as possible in the design process often led to a confusing and unpopular final product.\n\n**(4) Which of the following statements best describes Matrix's impact?**\n1. Many of the architectural techniques pioneered by Matrix eventually came to dominate the design processes taught in architecture schools today.\n2. Although the methods Matrix used to include ordinary people in the design process of buildings were too simple to be effective, they helped people feel included.\n3. People who were previously ignored became more confident to give their opinions regarding the design of spaces around them.\n4. Even though the group's members no longer do architecture-related work, designers of public areas continue to take inspiration from their principles.\n\n---\n**Answer Key:** (1) 3, (2) 4, (3) 2, (4) 3`,

      title: "Universal Design",
      content: `## Title: Universal Design\n\nWhen most people interact with everyday products or environments, they rarely think about the specific needs of the individuals who created them. However, in the latter half of the 20th century, a movement emerged that challenged the traditional "one-size-fits-all" approach to design. Led by figures such as Ronald Mace, an architect who used a wheelchair, this movement introduced the concept of "Universal Design." Its goal was to create environments and products that are usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialized design. Although the term was coined in the 1980s, the principles behind it have transformed how architects and designers approach their work today.\n\nThe philosophy that Universal Design sought to replace was one that often prioritized the capabilities of the average, able-bodied person. For decades, buildings and public spaces were constructed with features like stairs as the only means of entry, or narrow doorways that were impassable for wheelchair users. This approach was rooted in historical standards that treated disability as a medical problem requiring separate, specialized facilities rather than an issue of inclusive design. While these features were convenient for the majority, they created significant physical barriers for people with disabilities, the elderly, and even parents with strollers, effectively excluding them from full participation in society.\n\nUniversal Design, however, did not simply aim to add special features for people with disabilities. In fact, one of its core arguments was that designing for diverse abilities benefits everyone. Proponents reasoned that features like curb cuts—slopes in sidewalks originally designed for wheelchair users—also helped skateboarders, delivery workers with carts, and travelers with luggage. This phenomenon, where a solution for a specific group helps a much broader population, became known as the "curb-cut effect." Instead of creating separate entrances or adaptations, Universal Design advocated for integrating accessibility into the fundamental aesthetics and function of a building from the very beginning.\n\nOne clear example of these values in practice is the Ed Roberts Campus in Berkeley, California, a center for disability rights organizations. The building was designed with a spiraling ramp that serves as a central feature, not a hidden alternative. This ramp connects the floors in a way that is equally accessible and prominent for everyone, regardless of mobility. Additionally, the architects incorporated high-contrast colors and textured flooring to aid those with visual impairments. By consulting with a wide range of users during the planning stages, the designers ensured that the building did not just comply with legal codes but genuinely welcomed all visitors.\n\nUniversal Design has since expanded beyond architecture into product design, education, and digital technology. Many of the principles established by Mace and his colleagues have influenced legal standards, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act. Although the movement began as a response to the exclusion of people with disabilities, it has evolved into a broader commitment to social equity. By prioritizing flexibility and intuitive use, Universal Design empowers people of all ages and abilities to navigate the world with independence and dignity, ensuring that the built environment reflects the diversity of the human experience.`,
      questions: `### Questions\n\n**(1) What was the primary motivation behind the Universal Design movement?**\n1. To ensure that specialized products for people with disabilities were more affordable and widely available.\n2. To challenge the idea that design should only cater to the needs of the average, able-bodied person.\n3. To create a new set of strict legal codes that would punish architects who ignored safety regulations.\n4. To promote the work of Ronald Mace and help him gain recognition in the architectural community.\n\n**(2) What do we learn about the design approach that Universal Design sought to replace?**\n1. It often treated disability as a separate issue requiring specialized facilities rather than inclusive solutions.\n2. It focused heavily on aesthetic beauty, often ignoring the practical needs of even able-bodied users.\n3. It was created by medical professionals who believed that people with disabilities should not enter public buildings.\n4. It prioritized the construction of wide doorways and ramps, but failed to address other barriers like stairs.\n\n**(3) Proponents of Universal Design argued against separate adaptations because**\n1. adding special features for specific groups was often too expensive for most building owners to afford.\n2. they believed that designing for diverse abilities from the start would result in solutions that benefit everyone.\n3. the majority of people with disabilities preferred to use specialized facilities rather than integrated ones.\n4. distinct entrances for wheelchair users were often more convenient than trying to modify the main entrance.\n\n**(4) Which of the following statements best describes the impact of Universal Design?**\n1. Its influence is largely limited to the United States due to the specific legal requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n2. While it succeeded in changing architecture, it has failed to make any significant impact on product design or technology.\n3. It has evolved from a focus on disability into a broader philosophy that improves usability for people of all abilities.\n4.

The Problem with "Average" (第2段落)\nかつてのデザインは「平均的な健常者」を基準にしていました。階段のみの入り口などは、障害を「隔離すべき医学的問題」とみなす古い基準に基づいており、多くの人々を社会から排除していました。\n\n### 3. The Core Philosophy (第3段落)\nユニバーサルデザインは、単に障害者用の設備を追加するのではなく、最初から多様な人々を想定してデザインすることが全員の利益になる（カーブカット効果）と主張しました。隔離ではなく統合を目指しました。\n\n### 4. Design in Practice (第4段落)\n具体例として、エド・ロバーツ・キャンパスが挙げられます。ここではスロープが建物の中心的な特徴としてデザインされており、誰もが同じ動線を使えます。\n\n### 5. Legacy (第5段落)\nこの運動は建築を超えて広がり、ADAなどの法律にも影響を与えました。障害者排除への対応から始まったものが、社会的な公平性を目指すより広い理念へと進化しています。\n\n---\n講師用資料：授業前の確認や、生徒への解説の構成案としてご活用ください。`,
