# Workflow: Creating Original Questions for Grade 2 Part 3B

## Overview
This workflow defines the steps to create original reading problems for Eiken Grade 2 Part 3B and register them in `mockData.js`.

**Input:** Past exam data (OCR text or images providing context, questions, and answers)
**Output:** A new entry in `mockData.js` including `past`, `original`, and `analysis` sections.

## Phase 1: Analysis and Theme Selection

### 1.1 Data Extraction
1. Extract the full text (OCR) of the past exam passage.
2. Extract all questions and options.
3. Identify the correct answers.

### 1.2 Structural Analysis
| Item | Key Points |
|------|------------|
| Title | Year, Session, and Topic Name |
| Category | Environment, Science, Health, Education, Society, etc. |
| Paragraphs | usually 3–4 paragraphs |
| Word Count | ~300–350 words |
| Level | CEFR B1 (Eiken Grade 2) |

### 1.3 Theme Proposal
- Select a topic within the same category as the past exam but with a different specific subject.
- Ensure the topic is suitable for Grade 2 level learners.

## Phase 2: Registering to mockData.js

### 2.1 Update AVAILABLE_YEARS
Add a new entry to the `AVAILABLE_YEARS` array under the appropriate separator.

```javascript
{ year: 2024, session: 1, label: "2024-1 (Topic Name)" },
```

### 2.2 Add MOCK_DATA Entry
Append the new object to the `MOCK_DATA` export. Ensure the data follows the exact structure generated by the AI prompt.

```javascript
  "YYYY-S": {
    past: {
      title: "Title",
      content: `## Title: Title\n\n[Text]`,
      questions: `### Questions\n\n**(1) Question**\n1. ...`,
      translations: [
        { en: "Sentence...", ja: "訳..." }
      ]
    },
    original: {
      title: "Original Title",
      content: `## Title: Original Title\n\n[Original Text]`,
      questions: `### Original Questions\n\n**(1) Question**\n1. ...`,
      translations: [
        { en: "Sentence...", ja: "訳..." }
      ]
    },
    analysis: {
      intent: `## 作成意図・根拠 (Blueprint)\n\n...`,
      comparison: `## 過去問との比較分析\n\n...`,
      syntax: `## オリジナル本文の構文解説\n\n...`
    }
  }
```

## Phase 3: Content Standards

### 3.1 Synchronized Translations
The `translations` array must maintain a strict 1:1 mapping between English sentences and Japanese translations to support the popup translation feature.

### 3.2 Grammatical Analysis (Syntax)
Focus on Grade 2 key grammar points:
- Relative pronouns
- Present perfect
- Passive voice
- Infinitives
- Participial phrases

---

## Phase 4: Verification

// turbo
1. Run a syntax check using Node.js:
```powershell
node -e "const d = require('./src/data/mockData.js'); console.log('AVAILABLE_YEARS:', d.AVAILABLE_YEARS.length)"
```

2. Verify the display in the browser.

---

## Important Rules

### Formatting
- Passage titles must use `## Title: Title` format.
- Questions must be formatted as `**(1) Question Text**`.
- Answer keys must be at the end of the `questions` or `original.questions` string: `**Answer Key:** (1) X, (2) Y, (3) Z, (4) W`.

### Quality
- Original word count should be within ±30 words of the past exam (Target: 300-350).
- Vocabulary must follow CEFR B1 standards.
- Ensure every sentence ends with a punctuation mark followed by a single space.
